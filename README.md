A Visual Studio 2015 Solution to Parse a .txt file containing...words. 
The program will split on any non-word character (including '_') and count the occurrences of each word, ignoring lower/uppercase versions.
Built and Tested with VS2015 (Xamarin version) and NUnit 2.6 (vanilla, no mock plugins)

This is a Tech test.
